## Introduction

Algorithmic complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that measures the efficiency of algorithms. It helps us understand how the performance of an algorithm changes with the input size. In this repository, we will explore various algorithms and analyze their time and space complexities.

## Topics Covered

- Big O notation
- Time complexity analysis
- Common algorithmic paradigms (e.g., divide and conquer, dynamic programming)
- Sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, merge sort, quicksort)
- Searching algorithms (e.g., linear search, binary search)
- Graph algorithms (e.g., breadth-first search, depth-first search)
- And more!

## Getting Started
